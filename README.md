Weekly Challenge Module 6: Api's and Geospatial Data Visualization.

To complete this challenge I've used the following:
- class notes
- solved files
- 1 hour tutor Carlos Cattorno
- Xpert Assistence (AI)
- stack overflow
- Chat GPT

I've used both AI in ongoing conversations to describe the challenge, explain code and test alternatives. Whenever code was created by the AI I never copy and paste it into my file, but type everything manually so I can get more intimately aquinted with the syntax.
